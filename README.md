# Study of Diffusion and MDS Matrices in Symmetric
Block Ciphers (supporting codes)

Hello, my name is Ana Clara, and welcome to this repo. The goal of this repo is to keep supporting codes and data regarding my research work, **Study of Diffusion and MDS Matrices in Symmetric Block Ciphers**. 

Folders `diffusion_analysis_data` and `diffusion_analysis_code` refer to Chapters 1 to 5 from the thesis, containing codes and data used to:
- extract the ANFs of S-Boxes of DES, AES and SAFER
- model DES as a graph and analyze its diffusion property
- extract the DDTs and LATs of DES and AES S-Boxes

Folder `GA_code` refers to Chapters 7 and 8, containing the Genetic Algorithms implementation used in the work.

Finally, folder `GA_example_experiment_logs` contains three examples of log files from my experiments, so that readers can see what a log file looks like and gain a better understanding of the practical experiments conducted, since making all the logs available would require too much storage.

I believe these codes and data are the most relevant to complement my thesis.

If you are interested in other auxiliary scripts and code I used, for example, scripts I used to check MDS matrices from the literature and build the catalogue of Chapter 7, they are available at [this other repo](https://github.com/AnaClaraZoppiSerpa/Research). However, that repo is VERY messy, since I basically dumped everything there for ~2.5 years for backup purposes.

That said, if you have any questions about my work or my codes feel free to contact me (anaclara.zoppiserpa@gmail.com) and I'll try to help you. Thanks for the interest in my work!
